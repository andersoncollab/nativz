17:T54b,<p>Meta's Andromeda algorithm didn't just tweak the feed — it rebuilt the foundation of social media distribution. Before Andromeda, organic reach was dying a slow death. Brands that posted three times a week could still maintain visibility. That era is over.</p>
<p>Andromeda evaluates content across a pool of over 1,000 ranking signals, prioritizing <strong>creative diversity</strong>, <strong>engagement velocity</strong>, and <strong>content freshness</strong> over follower count. The algorithm rewards brands that produce at volume — 10 to 25 meaningfully different pieces of content per week — and punishes those that repeat the same formats.</p>
<p>This is not a minor shift. It is a complete inversion of how social media marketing works. Agencies still building three polished posts per week are handing their clients' reach to competitors who understood the change. Nativz understood it before it happened, because we studied the patents, tracked the beta rollouts, and rebuilt our production pipeline around creative volume from day one.</p>
<p>Our social media management service is engineered for this reality. We don't just "manage your accounts." We build content engines that feed the algorithm exactly what it wants — diverse, platform-native, engagement-optimized content produced at a pace that most agencies can't match.</p>6:["$","div","0",{"children":[["$","$L16",null,{"variant":"glow"}],["$","section",null,{"className":"relative py-24 md:py-32 overflow-hidden ","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"absolute inset-0 section-break-mesh"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"relative max-w-7xl mx-auto px-6","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-col lg:flex-row items-center gap-12 lg:gap-16","children":[["$","$L15",null,{"delay":80,"className":"flex-1 min-w-0","children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"flex items-start gap-5 mb-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"w-14 h-14 rounded-2xl bg-gradient-to-br from-sky-400 to-cyan-400 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold text-lg flex-shrink-0 shadow-lg shadow-electric-blue/10","children":"01"}],["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-2xl md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl font-bold text-white font-display leading-tight pt-2","children":"Social Media After Andromeda: Why Everything Changed"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-slate-300 text-lg leading-relaxed prose prose-invert prose-lg prose-cyan max-w-none [&>p]:mb-6 [&>ul]:my-6 [&>ul>li]:mb-3 [&_strong]:text-white","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$17"}}]]}]}],["$","$L15",null,{"delay":200,"className":"flex-1 min-w-0 w-full lg:w-auto","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"relative group","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"absolute -inset-4 bg-gradient-to-br from-sky-400 to-cyan-400 rounded-3xl opacity-[0.08] blur-2xl group-hover:opacity-[0.15] transition-opacity duration-500"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"relative overflow-hidden rounded-2xl border border-white/[0.08] shadow-2xl shadow-black/30","children":[["$","$L18",null,{"src":"/images/sections/social-media/strategy.png","alt":"Social Media After Andromeda: Why Everything Changed","width":640,"height":480,"className":"w-full h-auto object-cover aspect-[4/3] group-hover:scale-[1.03] transition-transform duration-700"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-t from-navy-dark/40 via-transparent to-transparent"}]]}]]}]}]]}],false]}]]}]]}]
19:T6ee,<p>Every platform has its own language. A Reel that stops thumbs on Instagram will fall flat on LinkedIn. A carousel that drives saves on Instagram needs a completely different structure than a thread on X. Most agencies recycle the same asset across every channel and call it a "multi-platform strategy." We don't.</p>
<p>Nativz builds <strong>platform-native content strategies</strong> for every channel we manage. That means:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instagram</strong>: Reels-first distribution with strategic carousel and static support. Optimized for saves, shares, and Explore page discovery.</li>
<li><strong>Facebook</strong>: Community-driven content that leverages Groups, Events, and Andromeda's preference for conversational engagement.</li>
<li><strong>TikTok</strong>: Trend-responsive, creator-style content shot in vertical format with native editing. Not repurposed Reels — original TikToks.</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn</strong>: Thought leadership content, employee advocacy programs, and B2B lead generation through document posts and newsletters.</li>
<li><strong>YouTube</strong>: Long-form video strategy paired with Shorts optimization for subscriber growth and search discoverability.</li>
<li><strong>X (Twitter)</strong>: Real-time engagement, brand voice development, and conversational content strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Pinterest</strong>: Visual search optimization and traffic-driving pin strategy for evergreen discovery.</li>
<li><strong>Threads</strong>: Conversational content integrated with your Meta ecosystem strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>We staff dedicated strategists for each platform — not generalists who treat every channel the same. This is why our clients see 3-5x the organic reach of brands using traditional posting schedules.</p>7:["$","div","1",{"children":[["$","$L16",null,{"variant":"dots"}],["$","section",null,{"className":"relative py-24 md:py-32 overflow-hidden section-alt-bg","children":[false,["$","div",null,{"className":"relative max-w-7xl mx-auto px-6","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-col lg:flex-row-reverse items-center gap-12 lg:gap-16","children":[["$","$L15",null,{"delay":80,"className":"flex-1 min-w-0","children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"flex items-start gap-5 mb-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"w-14 h-14 rounded-2xl bg-gradient-to-br from-sky-400 to-cyan-400 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold text-lg flex-shrink-0 shadow-lg shadow-electric-blue/10","children":"02"}],["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-2xl md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl font-bold text-white font-display leading-tight pt-2","children":"Our Approach: Platform-Native Content at Scale"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-slate-300 text-lg leading-relaxed prose prose-invert prose-lg prose-cyan max-w-none [&>p]:mb-6 [&>ul]:my-6 [&>ul>li]:mb-3 [&_strong]:text-white","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$19"}}]]}]}],["$","$L15",null,{"delay":200,"className":"flex-1 min-w-0 w-full lg:w-auto","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"relative group","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"absolute -inset-4 bg-gradient-to-br from-sky-400 to-cyan-400 rounded-3xl opacity-[0.08] blur-2xl group-hover:opacity-[0.15] transition-opacity duration-500"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"relative overflow-hidden rounded-2xl border border-white/[0.08] shadow-2xl shadow-black/30","children":[["$","$L18",null,{"src":"/images/sections/social-media/engagement.png","alt":"Our Approach: Platform-Native Content at Scale","width":640,"height":480,"className":"w-full h-auto object-cover aspect-[4/3] group-hover:scale-[1.03] transition-transform duration-700"}],"$L1a"]}]]}]}]]}],"$L1b"]}]]}]]}]
1c:T483,<p>The single biggest competitive advantage in social media today is <strong>creative volume</strong>. Not budget. Not follower count. Volume.</p>
<p>Here's why: Andromeda and its equivalents across TikTok, YouTube, and LinkedIn use machine learning to test content against micro-audiences before deciding whether to distribute it broadly. The more unique pieces of content you publish, the more "at-bats" you get with the algorithm. Brands producing 15-20 pieces per week simply get more distribution opportunities than brands producing 3-5.</p>
<p>But volume without quality is noise. Nativz solves this with our <strong>Film Day Model</strong>: a single production day generates enough raw footage, photography, and creative assets to fuel an entire month of content across every platform. Our editing team then produces dozens of unique variations — different hooks, different formats, different aspect ratios — from that single day's shoot.</p>
<p>The result: your brand publishes at the volume algorithms demand, with the quality your audience expects, at a cost that makes sense. One film day. One month of content. That's the Nativz model.</p>8:["$","div","2",{"children":[["$","$L16",null,{"variant":"mesh"}],["$","section",null,{"className":"relative py-24 md:py-32 overflow-hidden ","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"absolute inset-0 section-break-mesh"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"relative max-w-7xl mx-auto px-6","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-col lg:flex-row items-center gap-12 lg:gap-16","children":[["$","$L15",null,{"delay":80,"className":"flex-1 min-w-0","children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"flex items-start gap-5 mb-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"w-14 h-14 rounded-2xl bg-gradient-to-br from-sky-400 to-cyan-400 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold text-lg flex-shrink-0 shadow-lg shadow-electric-blue/10","children":"03"}],["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-2xl md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl font-bold text-white font-display leading-tight pt-2","children":"Creative Volume: The New Competitive Advantage"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-slate-300 text-lg leading-relaxed prose prose-invert prose-lg prose-cyan max-w-none [&>p]:mb-6 [&>ul]:my-6 [&>ul>li]:mb-3 [&_strong]:text-white","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$1c"}}]]}]}],["$","$L15",null,{"delay":200,"className":"flex-1 min-w-0 w-full lg:w-auto","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"relative group","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"absolute -inset-4 bg-gradient-to-br from-sky-400 to-cyan-400 rounded-3xl opacity-[0.08] blur-2xl group-hover:opacity-[0.15] transition-opacity duration-500"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"relative overflow-hidden rounded-2xl border border-white/[0.08] shadow-2xl shadow-black/30","children":[["$","$L18",null,{"src":"/images/sections/social-media/content-creation.png","alt":"Creative Volume: The New Competitive Advantage","width":640,"height":480,"className":"w-full h-auto object-cover aspect-[4/3] group-hover:scale-[1.03] transition-transform duration-700"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-t from-navy-dark/40 via-transparent to-transparent"}]]}]]}]}]]}],false]}]]}]]}]

<p>Nativz provides <strong>active community management</strong> across every platform we manage. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Response time SLAs</strong>: We respond to comments and DMs within defined windows, ensuring no engagement opportunity is missed.</li>

<li><strong>Reputation monitoring</strong>: We track brand mentions, sentiment, and competitive conversations across all platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Lead routing</strong>: High-intent DMs and comments are flagged and routed to your sales team in real time.</li>

The exact volume depends on your plan and the number of platforms we manage. Every piece is platform-native — not recycled across channels."},{"question":"Which social media platforms does Nativz manage?","answer":"We manage Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, YouTube, X (Twitter), Pinterest, and Threads. Most clients start with 2-4 platforms and expand as their content engine matures. We'll recommend the right platform mix based on your audience and goals."},{"question":"Do you create all the content, or do we need to provide assets?","answer":"We create everything. Our Film Day model produces all the video, photography, and raw assets needed for a full month of content. You don't need to provide anything beyond brand guidelines and access to your locations or products for shoot days."},{"question":"How does Nativz handle content approvals?","answer":"We deliver a complete monthly content calendar for your review and approval before anything is published. You'll see every post, caption, and visual in advance. Revisions are built into our workflow, and we use shared collaboration tools to make approvals fast and painless."},{"question":"What results can we expect from social media management?","answer":"Results vary by industry and starting point, but our clients typically see 3-5x increases in organic reach within the first 90 days, significant growth in engagement rates, and measurable increases in website traffic from social channels. We set specific KPIs during onboarding and report against them monthly."},{"question":"How is Nativz different from other social media agencies?","answer":"Three things: creative volume, platform-native strategy, and the Andromeda-first approach. Most agencies still operate on a 3-posts-per-week model built for 2019 algorithms. We produce at the volume modern algorithms reward, with content built specifically for each platform — not recycled Canva templates posted everywhere."},{"question":"What is the typical contract length?","answer":"We recommend a minimum 90-day engagement to allow the algorithm to learn and optimize around your content. Most clients work with us on 6-12 month agreements. We don't lock you in — our retention rate speaks for itself."}]}]}]}]
