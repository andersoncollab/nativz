9:T730,<p>A successful digital marketing strategy isn't about picking one channel — it's about building a <strong>full-funnel system</strong> where multiple channels work together to attract, engage, and convert customers. Here are the 7 essential types of digital marketing every business should understand.</p>
<h2>1. Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h2>
<p>SEO is the foundation of organic visibility. It drives long-term, compounding traffic growth and builds credibility through high search rankings.</p>
<h2>2. Pay-Per-Click Advertising (PPC)</h2>
<p>PPC delivers immediate visibility and traffic through Google Ads, Meta Ads, and other paid platforms. It's the fastest way to generate leads and sales.</p>
<h2>3. Social Media Marketing</h2>
<p>Social media builds brand awareness, community, and direct customer relationships across platforms like Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, and Facebook.</p>
<h2>4. Content Marketing</h2>
<p>Content marketing creates and distributes valuable content that attracts and retains a clearly defined audience, ultimately driving profitable customer action.</p>
<h2>5. Email Marketing</h2>
<p>Email marketing nurtures leads and drives repeat purchases through automated sequences, newsletters, and targeted campaigns.</p>
<h2>6. Video Marketing</h2>
<p>Video content drives engagement across social media, websites, and advertising platforms. Short-form video (Reels, TikTok) is currently the highest-engagement format.</p>
<h2>7. AI & Answer Engine Optimization</h2>
<p>The newest frontier — optimizing your brand's visibility in AI-powered search engines, ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews, and other LLM platforms.</p>
