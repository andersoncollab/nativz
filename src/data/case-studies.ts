        challenge: `<p>RUJO Boots was a brand-new entrant into the fiercely competitive cowboy boot and western wear market. With no existing brand awareness, no customer base, and established competitors dominating the space, the challenge was clear: launch an aggressive growth marketing campaign to introduce the brand and penetrate a market that is notoriously difficult to enter.</p>`,
        process: `<p>Cole Feigl headlined much of the brand's creative decision-making. Joining forces, Nativz was hired to launch an aggressive growth marketing campaign. Our strategy centered around:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integrated marketing communications</strong> across all digital channels</li>
<li><strong>Strong brand identity development</strong> built around the "Be Brave" slogan</li>
<li><strong>Sharp commercial production</strong> centered around skydiving, extreme sports, MMA, barrel racing, rodeo, blue-collar America, Texas culture, and western landscapes</li>
<li><strong>Market research</strong> to identify underserved audience segments</li>
<li><strong>Referral & loyalty programs</strong> to drive word-of-mouth growth</li>
<li><strong>Multichannel marketing funnels</strong> with conversion rate optimization</li>
</ul>
<p>We utilized a slow but steady approach, leaning primarily into return-focused paid advertising campaigns to compound growth over 2 years.</p>`,
        results: `<p>Years later, RUJO Boots is a <strong>multi-million dollar brand</strong> with tens of thousands of loyal fans around the United States. Our paid media efforts have been directly attributed to over <strong>$1.8 million in sales</strong>.</p>
<p>Our public relations strategy secured mainstream media attention including pickups from <strong>Yahoo Finance, Business Insider, Market Watch, Morningstar, Benzinga, the Dallas Morning News, Texas Monthly</strong>, and more.</p>
<p>Today, we continue to grow the RUJO brand to new heights and further acquire market share in western wear.</p>`,
